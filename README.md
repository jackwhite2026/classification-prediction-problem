# Overview

The goal of this classification prediction problem is to predict if a airbnb host is a normal host or superhost. In order to do this, this repository includes a variety of attempts where I run different models and analyze their results

# Organization 

In this repo, there are folders for each attempt with readmes in each folder. The 0a & 0b r scripts contain work that was done that is carried through all attempts, such as the data cleaning and initial setup. There is also a data folder with the training set, testing set, folds, and data dictionary.
